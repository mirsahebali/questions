1. **State Management:**

   - **Question:** Compare local component state with global state management solutions like Redux. When would you choose one over the other?
   - **Answer:** Local component state is suitable for managing component-specific data, while global state management solutions like Redux are ideal for managing application-wide state. Use Redux when you need a predictable state container that can be accessed by multiple components or when the application state becomes complex.

2. **React Router:**

   - **Question:** How does React Router enable client-side routing in a React application?
   - **Answer:** React Router is a library that enables navigation in a React application by mapping components to specific URLs. It provides `<Route>` components to define routes and a `<BrowserRouter>` or `<HashRouter>` to manage the application's navigation state.

3. **Higher-Order Components (HOCs):**

   - **Question:** Explain what a Higher-Order Component (HOC) is and how it can be used in React.
   - **Answer:** A Higher-Order Component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props or behavior. HOCs are often used for code reuse, prop manipulation, and abstraction of logic that can be applied to multiple components.

4. **Error Boundaries:**

   - **Question:** What is an error boundary in React, and how can it be implemented?
   - **Answer:** An error boundary is a React component that catches JavaScript errors anywhere in its child component tree and logs those errors. It is implemented using the `componentDidCatch` lifecycle method. Error boundaries help prevent the entire application from crashing due to unhandled errors.

5. **Performance Optimization:**

   - **Question:** Discuss ways to optimize the performance of a React application.
   - **Answer:** Performance optimization techniques include using memoization, implementing shouldComponentUpdate or React.memo, code splitting, and lazy loading components. Additionally, using the React DevTools profiler and minimizing unnecessary re-renders can contribute to improved performance.

6. **Testing in React:**

   - **Question:** Explain the importance of unit testing in a React application. How would you test a React component using tools like Jest and React Testing Library?
   - **Answer:** Unit testing is crucial for ensuring the correctness of individual components. Jest is a popular testing framework, and React Testing Library provides utilities for testing React components by simulating user interactions and asserting on the rendered output.

7. **Code Splitting:**

   - **Question:** What is code splitting, and how can it be implemented in a React application?
   - **Answer:** Code splitting is a technique to split the application code into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand. React.lazy and Suspense can be used for code splitting. This helps reduce the initial load time and improves the overall performance of the application.

8. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):**
   - **Question:** Explain the concept of Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in React. What are its advantages?
   - **Answer:** SSR involves rendering React components on the server and sending the fully rendered HTML to the client. Advantages include improved SEO, faster initial load times, and better performance on low-powered devices. Libraries like Next.js facilitate SSR in React applications.
