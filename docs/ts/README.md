1. **Advanced TypeScript Concepts:**

   - **Question:** Explain the difference between `interface` and `type` in TypeScript.
   - **Answer:** In TypeScript, both `interface` and `type` can be used to define custom data types. However, there are some differences. An `interface` is used to define a contract that an object must adhere to, while a `type` is more versatile and can be used to create union types, intersections, and mapped types. Generally, if you need to extend or implement, use `interface`; if you need a union or mapped type, use `type`.

2. **Generics:**

   - **Question:** What are generics in TypeScript, and how are they used?
   - **Answer:** Generics allow the creation of reusable components that can work with different data types while maintaining type safety. They are indicated by the use of angle brackets `<T>`. For example, a generic function might be defined as `function identity<T>(arg: T): T { return arg; }`. This function can then be used with various types.

3. **Advanced Type Manipulation:**

   - **Question:** Explain the use of conditional types in TypeScript.
   - **Answer:** Conditional types in TypeScript allow you to create types that depend on a condition. For example, you can create a type that selects one type or another based on a condition: `type MyType<T> = T extends string ? string : number;`. This type will be `string` if `T` extends `string`, otherwise, it will be `number`.

4. **Decorators:**

   - **Question:** What are decorators in TypeScript, and where might you use them in a React application?
   - **Answer:** Decorators are a way to modify or annotate classes and their members. In TypeScript, decorators are prefixed with the `@` symbol. They are commonly used in frameworks like Angular for metadata annotations. In React, decorators might be used for higher-order component patterns or to augment the behavior of class components.

5. **Advanced TypeScript Patterns:**

   - **Question:** Explain the concept of mapped types in TypeScript.
   - **Answer:** Mapped types in TypeScript allow the creation of new types based on the properties of an existing type. For example, you can create a type that makes all properties of an interface optional: `type Partial<T> = { [P in keyof T]?: T[P]; }`.

6. **Async Programming:**

   - **Question:** Describe how you handle asynchronous operations in TypeScript, especially in the context of React.
   - **Answer:** Asynchronous operations in TypeScript are often handled using promises and async/await syntax. In React, `useEffect` can be used for asynchronous operations, and the `axios` library or the `fetch` API can be used for making asynchronous requests.

7. **TypeScript with React:**
   - **Question:** How do you handle React component prop types in a TypeScript project?
   - **Answer:** In TypeScript, you can use the `prop-types` library for runtime type checking, or you can utilize TypeScript's static type checking. With TypeScript, you can define the prop types directly in the component's interface or type.
