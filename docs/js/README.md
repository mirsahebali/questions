#### Core JavaScript Concepts:

1. **Scope and Closures:**

   - _Question:_ Explain lexical scope in JavaScript.
   - _Answer:_ Lexical scope means that the scope of a variable is determined by its location within the source code. Variables declared outside a function are in the global scope, while variables declared inside a function are in the local scope.

2. **Prototypes and Inheritance:**

   - _Question:_ Explain prototype-based inheritance in JavaScript.
   - _Answer:_ In prototype-based inheritance, objects inherit properties and behaviors from other objects through their prototypes. Each object has a prototype, and if a property or method is not found on the object itself, JavaScript looks for it in the object's prototype chain.

3. **Asynchronous JavaScript:**
   - _Question:_ How does the event loop work in JavaScript?
   - _Answer:_ The event loop is a core concept that allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations. It continuously checks the message queue for tasks, executes them one by one, and returns control to the browser when the call stack is empty.

#### ES6+ Features:

4. **Arrow Functions:** \*\*

   - _Question:_ What is the difference between regular functions and arrow functions?
   - _Answer:_ Arrow functions have a shorter syntax, don't bind their own `this`, and don't have their own `arguments` object. They are suitable for concise one-liners and for functions where `this` should be lexically scoped.

5. **Destructuring and Spread/Rest Operators:** \*\*

   - _Question:_ Provide examples of object and array destructuring.
   - _Answer:_ Object Destructuring: `const { name, age } = person;` Array Destructuring: `const [first, second] = array;`

6. **Classes and Modules:**
   - _Question:_ Explain the concept of classes in ES6.
   - _Answer:_ Classes in ES6 provide a more convenient syntax for constructor functions and prototype-based inheritance. They encapsulate data and behavior into a single unit.

#### Web APIs and Browser Environment:

7. **DOM Manipulation:**

   - _Question:_ Explain event delegation in JavaScript.
   - _Answer:_ Event delegation is a technique where a single event listener is attached to a common ancestor instead of individual elements. This improves performance and simplifies code, especially for dynamically generated content.

8. **AJAX and Fetch API:**
   - _Question:_ Compare `XMLHttpRequest` with the `Fetch` API.
   - _Answer:_ `Fetch` is more modern, returns Promises, has a simpler syntax, and supports a more flexible request/response structure compared to the older `XMLHttpRequest`.

#### Testing and Debugging:

9.  **Testing:**

    - _Question:_ Name a JavaScript testing library/framework.
    - _Answer:_ Examples include Jasmine, Mocha, Jest, and QUnit.

    - _Question_: What is TDD and why is it important?
    - _Answer_: Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code implementation. The development process in TDD follows a cycle: write a test, make it fail, implement the code to make the test pass, and then refactor the code while ensuring the tests still pass. This cycle is often referred to as the "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle.

      - Key Steps in TDD:

                - Write a Test (Red): Create a test that defines a function or improvements of a function,
                  which should fail initially because the function is not yet implemented.

                - Write the Code (Green): Write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass.

                - Refactor (Refactor): Clean up the code while ensuring that the tests still pass.
                  Refactoring does not involve changing the external behavior of the code but improves its internal structure.

      - Why TDD is Important:

                _Early Detection of Bugs_

                _Improved Code Quality_

                _Simplified Debugging_

                _Continuous Validation_

                _Facilitates Refactoring_

                _Documentation_

                _Increased Confidence_

                _Collaboration_

                _Time Savings_

                _Supports Agile Practices_

10. **Debugging:**

    - _Question:_ How would you debug a performance issue in a web application?
    - _Answer:_ I would use browser developer tools, profiling tools, and auditing tools to identify bottlenecks, analyze memory usage, and optimize code accordingly.

#### Performance Optimization

11. **Memory Management:**

    - _Question:_ How does garbage collection work in JavaScript?What algorithm does JavaScript use for garbage collection?
    - _Answer:_ Garbage collection is the process of automatically reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use. JavaScript uses a mark-and-sweep algorithm.

#### Additional Topics:

12. **Security:**

    - _Question:_ How can Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks be prevented?
    - _Answer:_ Sanitize user input, use secure coding practices, and implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.

13. **Build Tools and Task Runners:**

    - _Question:_ Name a popular JavaScript build tool.
    - _Answer:_ Webpack is a widely used build tool in the JavaScript ecosystem.

#### Project Experience:

14. **Project Architecture:**

    - _Question:_ How do you ensure code maintainability in a large project?
    - _Answer:_ I follow modular design principles, use consistent coding patterns, and document the codebase. Additionally, regular refactoring and code reviews contribute to maintainability.

15. **Design Patterns:**

    - _Question:_ What are some design patterns in JavaScript?
    - _Answer:_ Some common design patterns in JavaScript include Singleton, Observer, Factory, Decorator, and Adapter.

    - _Question_: What are some design principles in JavaScript?
    - _Answer_: Some common design principles in JavaScript include SRP, OCP, and DRY.

    - _Question_: Explain Observer and Factory patterns.
    - _Answer_: Observer pattern is used to notify listeners of an event when an object changes its state. Factory pattern is used to create objects without having to specify their class.
